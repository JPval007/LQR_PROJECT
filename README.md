# LQR_PROJECT

For this project the main goal was to design and implement a controller for a Buck converter, using modern modeling and control techniques.
This project was divided in three phases:

1. Modeling:
The system model was created by using a state space model with the capacitor voltage as a state variable and an observer to estimate the inductor current to complete it.

2. Design and simulations of the controller

3. Physical system and TivaC LQR code
